Given the set of descriptions, output all possible layouts that fit the constraints
- constraint satisfaction based on all given descriptions
- aay have free variables/multiple possible valid results
- always contains the intended correct result

Input descriptions in succession and output the updated possible layouts after each additional constraint
- allow for input updating new relations
- most recent output of layouts fits all constraints given up to and including the most recently added one

Extras
- Parameters: error type, probability of error
- Error types: left/right or top/down switches, flips/rotations, ...
- Probability of error: alter layouts to reflect the given error type according to the given probability
- Throw error if constraint(s) are impossible to realize for any of the layouts up to date?


More Ideas:
Use "relation" instead of position

Create class of positions
Dog.leftOf(Cat)
to add the positions
for now, have leftOf and relations be in the same straight line
leftOf includes the in same row/line constraint. we can remove it later on

have a 6x6 grid to incorporate all possible formations of 6 room relations
maintain grid for each animal and block out impossible locations given constraints
overlay/find intersections
