Given the set of descriptions, output all possible layouts that fit the constraints
- constraint satisfaction based on all given descriptions
- aay have free variables/multiple possible valid results
- always contains the intended correct result

Input descriptions in succession and output the updated possible layouts after each additional constraint
- allow for input updating new relations
- most recent output of layouts fits all constraints given up to and including the most recently added one

Extras
- Parameters: error type, probability of error
- Error types: left/right or top/down switches, flips/rotations, ...
- Probability of error: alter layouts to reflect the given error type according to the given probability

Questions
- How to handle inputs in the set or additional input constraints that are impossible to realize for any of the
  possible layouts up to date?
